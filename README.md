# Unity Gateway (`ug`)

Existing `ucode` commands continue to work unchanged. Going forward, the CLI is named Unity
Gateway and its primary command is `ug`; `ucode` remains a supported alias.

Unity Gateway is a lightweight launcher for running Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode,
GitHub Copilot CLI, and Pi through Databricks.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+ — install with `uv` ([uv.astral.sh](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/))
- `npm` if tool CLIs need to be installed automatically

## Installation

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/databricks/unity-gateway
```

To enable the optional custom-client OAuth flow, install the `custom-oauth` extra:

```bash
uv tool install "ucode[custom-oauth] @ git+https://github.com/databricks/unity-gateway"
```

Check your version with `ug --version`. Between releases this looks like
`0.1.0+14.g93986a8` — the trailing `g<hash>` is the exact commit the build came
from, so include it when reporting a bug.

---

## Usage

Just run the tool you want:

```bash
ug codex      # OpenAI Codex
ug claude     # Claude Code
ug gemini     # Gemini CLI
ug opencode   # OpenCode
ug copilot    # GitHub Copilot CLI
ug pi         # Pi
ug cursor     # Cursor Agent (MCP only — see below)
```

On first launch, `ug` will prompt for your Databricks workspace URL, authenticate, and configure that tool automatically. Subsequent Claude and Codex launches use the generated local settings directly. Use `ug claude --refresh` or `ug codex --refresh` when you want to re-check Databricks and update the model/configuration.

Pass flags directly to the underlying tool:

```bash
ug claude -r          # resume last session
ug codex --full-auto
```

All agents route through Databricks AI Gateway using your workspace credentials — no API keys required.

Smart routing is opt-in for Codex and Claude Code. Enabling it for a launch asks the AI Gateway
router to select models for that session and its subagents. Codex may require one-time review of
the launch-scoped hooks through `/hooks`.

```bash
ug codex --enable-smart-routing
ug claude --enable-smart-routing
```

The flag applies only to that launch; later launches use normal model selection unless the flag is
passed again. Smart routing uses the `task_v2` router by default. Power users can select another
router for a launch by setting `SMART_ROUTER_NAME`, for example
`SMART_ROUTER_NAME=task_v1 ug codex --enable-smart-routing`.

To configure all tools at once:

```bash
ug configure
```

To configure specific tools without the picker, pass a comma-separated list:

```bash
ug configure --agents claude,codex
```

Available agent names are `codex`, `claude`, `gemini`, `opencode`, `copilot`, and `pi`. `cursor` is also accepted (MCP-only — it registers Databricks MCP servers but configures no models).

Naming agents explicitly is treated as a request for all of them: if any one isn't available on the workspace, the run fails without configuring the others. Add `--skip-unavailable` to configure the available subset instead and skip the rest with a warning:

```bash
ug configure --agents claude,codex,pi --skip-unavailable
```

This is useful in CI against a mix of workspaces — on a workspace whose AI Gateway exposes no OpenAI models, the command above still configures `claude` and `pi`, and reports Codex as skipped. It exits non-zero only when none of the requested agents are available.

To configure without the workspace picker, pass a comma-separated list of workspaces:

```bash
ug configure --workspaces https://first.databricks.com,https://second.databricks.com
```

When multiple workspaces are provided, `ug` logs into and saves state for each workspace. Launch commands such as `ug codex` use the first workspace in the list.

Alternatively, pass existing Databricks CLI profiles (from `~/.databrickscfg`) instead of workspace URLs — each profile's host supplies the workspace URL:

```bash
ug configure --profiles DEFAULT --agents claude,codex
```

Auth behaves the same as `--workspaces`: an OAuth `databricks auth login` is forced by default.

For CI or headless environments where the profile holds a personal access token (`auth_type = pat` in `~/.databrickscfg`), add `--use-pat`. It must be combined with `--profiles` — ug never picks up a PAT implicitly — and runs no interactive login: the profile's token is used for the whole setup (and by launched agents afterwards), with workspace access verified against the AI Gateway. `--skip-validate` additionally skips the post-configure test message sent through each agent, so configure only writes config files with the freshly discovered models. Together these make setup fully non-interactive:

```bash
ug configure --profiles DEFAULT --agents claude,codex --use-pat --skip-validate --skip-upgrade
```

### MCP servers (optional)

```bash
ug configure mcp
```

Add Databricks MCP servers to installed MCP-capable tools: Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, GitHub Copilot CLI, and Cursor Agent.

The interactive picker discovers **MCP services** (the `system.ai.*` and workspace-wide
`<catalog>.<schema>` Unity Catalog MCP services) and a custom MCP server URL.

V2 AI Gateway servers — Vector Search, UC Functions, external connections, Genie spaces, and
Databricks apps — are **not** offered in the picker, because consumer-only identities can't
reach the V2 AI Gateway. Workspace users add them non-interactively by naming them in
`--services` with a typed selector:

```bash
ug mcp add --services vector-search:main.docs
ug mcp add --services uc-functions:main.tools
ug mcp add --services external:my-connection
ug mcp add --services genie-space:<space-id>
ug mcp add --services app:my-app
```

These require workspace access; a consumer-only identity is gated at the AI Gateway (which
`ug` already hits when it sets up models), not by this command.

Every Databricks MCP server is registered as a local **stdio** server that runs `ug mcp-proxy`
— a small bridge (shipped with `ug`) between the coding tool and the Databricks
streamable-HTTP MCP endpoint. The proxy mints a fresh OAuth token from your Databricks CLI profile
on every request, so MCP auth is handled uniformly for every client and never expires mid-session.
The coding tool starts and stops the proxy as a child process; there's nothing extra to run.

**Cursor** is MCP-only: `cursor-agent` runs models on your own Cursor account, so `ug`
configures no models for it — it only registers Databricks MCP servers in `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
(via the same proxy). Include it with `ug configure --agents cursor` or pick it in
`ug configure mcp`, then launch with `ug cursor`.

To set up an agent and its MCP server(s) in one command, pass `--mcp` with fully-qualified
service name(s) to `ug configure`:

```bash
ug configure --agents claude --mcp system.ai.slack
```

`--mcp` also works without `--agents` for MCP-only clients (it configures just the workspace,
then registers the servers); pass a comma-separated list to register several at once.

#### Add servers without replacing existing ones

`ug configure mcp` **replaces** the registered MCP servers with your selection — anything
outside a `--location`/`--services` scope (or left unchecked in the picker) is removed. To
**add** servers while leaving everything already configured in place, use `ug mcp add`:

```bash
# Register a whole schema's services, keeping any servers already configured.
ug mcp add --location system.ai

# Register just a subset (same name rules as `configure mcp --services`).
ug mcp add --services system.ai.slack,system.ai.github

# No arguments launches the same interactive picker, but never removes servers.
ug mcp add
```

`ug mcp add` takes the same `--location` and `--services` options as `ug configure mcp`;
the only difference is that it never removes servers outside the selection. In the interactive
picker, servers you already have configured are shown as `(already configured)` and can't be
toggled off — you only pick new ones to add.

Pass `--agents` to target specific coding agents. Any named agent that isn't set up yet is
configured first (workspace + models), so this doubles as one-command setup:

```bash
# Set up Claude Code (if needed) and register the server for it, in one command.
ug mcp add --agents claude --services system.ai.slack

# Target several agents at once.
ug mcp add --agents claude,codex --location system.ai
```

Without `--agents`, the server is registered for every already-configured agent.

#### Remove configured servers

To unregister servers you've already configured, use `ug mcp remove`:

```bash
ug mcp remove

# Remove only from specific agents. A server registered on several agents is
# unregistered from the named ones and kept on the rest.
ug mcp remove --agents codex
```

It shows the servers you currently have configured — each with the coding tools it's registered
on — and removes the ones you select from those tools. It needs no Databricks login.

### Skills (optional)

Configure Unity Catalog Skills for your coding tools with `ug configure skills`:

```bash
# Utility tools only: register the schema-less skills MCP connection, no download.
ug configure skills

# Download mode: fetch every skill in the schema to disk (and register the connection).
ug configure skills --location main.default --path /abs/project/dir

# Download a named subset of the schema's skills instead of all of them.
ug configure skills --location main.default --skill my-skill

# MCP mode: expose the schema's skills as MCP tools instead of downloading.
ug configure skills --location main.default,ml.prod --mcp
```

- **Bare command** (no `--location`) registers the schema-less skills MCP connection — the
  cross-schema utility tools only — and downloads nothing. `--mcp` with no `--location` does the
  same.
- **Download mode** (with `--location`, no `--mcp`) writes each skill flat as `<leaf>/SKILL.md`
  (plus its bundled files) into both `.claude/skills/` and `.agents/skills/`. `--path` (an existing
  absolute project directory) is optional; when omitted, skills are written to user-level skill
  directories. Any pre-existing skill dir prompts before it's overwritten. It then registers a
  schema-less skills MCP connection, leaving any prior `--mcp` scope untouched.
  `--skill <name>[,<name>…]` narrows the download to the named skills (by leaf name) from the schema
  instead of all of them; requested names not found in the schema warn and are skipped. `--skill`
  requires a single `--location`, is download-only, and is rejected with `--mcp`.
- **MCP mode** (`--location … --mcp`) sets the connection's location set to exactly `<list>`
  (override-only) and rebuilds its `?schema=` URL; no files are downloaded and `--path` is rejected.

Each run prints the registered server, its URL, the configured agents, and its tools, and reminds
you to run `ug <agent>` (existing agent sessions need a restart before the MCP tools load).

#### Add skill scopes without replacing existing ones

`ucode skill add` registers skills additively, keeping anything already configured. With `--mcp` it
adds the schemas to the connection's scope, otherwise it downloads their skills to disk. `--skills`
narrows a download to a subset of one schema's skills.

```bash
# Add schemas to the skills MCP scope, keeping any already configured.
ucode skill add --location main.default,ml.prod --mcp

# Download a schema's skills to disk, keeping existing downloads.
ucode skill add --location main.default

# Download a named subset, by bare name (with --location) or fully-qualified name.
ucode skill add --location main.default --skills my-skill,other-skill
ucode skill add --skills main.default.my-skill,main.default.other-skill
```

### Managed config for a workspace (admins)

Author the coding config your developers pick up automatically, instead of asking each of them to
run `ug configure` by hand. Restricted to workspace admins. `ug setup help` prints the whole
sequence; the short version is one command for the agents and models, then a command per optional
section, then publish:

```bash
ug setup                 # agents and models (start here)
ug setup mcps            # managed MCP servers
ug setup skills          # managed skills
ug setup spend-tiers     # spend-based routing
ug publish                 # publish it to the workspace
```

`ug setup` walks through the agents to enable and which one bare `ug` launches, then per agent:
Databricks-hosted models or an external Model Provider Service and the models to expose. Interactive
Claude Code and Codex configuration installs gateway-critical values in the OS-managed settings
scope so enterprise settings cannot silently override Unity Gateway. Non-interactive and CI runs use local
files without invoking `sudo`, and stop with an actionable error if an existing managed value
conflicts. Claude subscription relay is local-only because its loopback proxy exists only for that
session.
Claude Code is asked one model per family (opus/sonnet/haiku/fable), since it selects models by family
alias; any family can be skipped.

The optional sections each edit their own part of the same config, so you can add an MCP server or
change a spend tier later without walking the whole flow. `ug setup skills --location
main.default,other.schema` skips the prompt. `ug setup spend-tiers` sets a tiered spend policy
that switches the default agent and model as the workspace burns through a budget. Each section
command also offers to publish right away, so you can apply changes incrementally; answering the
section prompts also runs the matching `ug configure` step, which does configure this machine.

Everything is written to `~/.ucode/managed-state.json` — the one local managed-config file — which
`ug publish` publishes. Re-running `ug setup` keeps the MCP servers, skills, tracing table, and
tiered spend policy already authored, rather than clearing them; to drop one, edit the file and reload
it with `ug setup --from-file`.

```bash
# Review the manifest and the exact payload `ug publish` would publish.
ug setup show

# Skip the prompts and load a hand-written config instead (validated before saving).
ug setup --from-file ./managed-config.json
```

Once the manifest looks right, publish it:

```bash
# Validate, show a diff against what's live, and ask before publishing.
ug publish

# Publish without the confirmation prompt (for CI).
ug publish --yes

# Publish a config file exported with `ug export` instead of the locally authored one.
ug publish -f ./managed-config.json
ug publish --file ./managed-config.json --yes
```

`publish` updates the workspace's existing config in place rather than replacing it, so a failed
publish leaves the current config intact. It shows a diff of exactly what changes against the
published config before asking to confirm, and does nothing when the two already match. It is a
whole-manifest write — every field ug authors is sent — but because `ug setup` carries the
other sections forward, a re-run no longer silently drops them. Developers pick the new config up on
their next ug run.

With `-f`/`--file`, `publish` reads a config file produced by `ug export` and publishes it through
the same validation, diff, and confirmation flow. The file's `workspace` must match the configured
workspace (it can never redirect publication elsewhere) and its `spec_version` must be a supported
integer; server-owned fields (resource name, workspace ids, timestamps, user ids) and unknown fields
are rejected rather than silently dropped.

### Exporting the config

Any user (not only admins) can print the workspace's managed config as portable JSON with `ug
export`. The output leads with the source `workspace` URL and a `spec_version` (the export format
version), followed by the canonical external config; credentials and server-assigned fields (the
resource name, timestamps, user ids) are excluded. Without `--file` the JSON is written to stdout;
with `--file`/`-f` the same bytes are written to a file (atomically, and the destination's parent
directory must already exist) while stdout stays empty. The exported file is exactly what `ug
publish -f <file>` consumes.

```bash
# Print the managed config as JSON.
ug export

# Write it to a file; stdout stays empty.
ug export --file ./managed-config.json
```

The output looks like:

```json
{
  "workspace": "https://<workspace-host>",
  "spec_version": 1,
  "default_agent": "CODING_AGENT_CLAUDE_CODE",
  "enabled_agents": [ ... ]
}
```

## Managed Local Files

`ug` manages these files:

| File | Tool |
|------|------|
| `~/.codex/ucode.config.toml` (or legacy `~/.codex/config.toml`) | Codex |
| `~/.codex/ucode-models.json` | Codex static model catalog generated by ug |
| `~/.claude/ucode-settings.json` | Claude Code settings generated by ug |
| `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json` (Linux) or `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json` (macOS) | Claude Code OS-managed settings |
| `/etc/codex/managed_config.toml` | Codex OS-managed settings |
| `~/.gemini/.env` | Gemini CLI |
| `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` | OpenCode |
| `~/.copilot/.env` | GitHub Copilot CLI |
| `~/.pi/agent/models.json` | Pi |
| `~/.cursor/mcp.json` | Cursor Agent (MCP servers only) |
| `~/.ucode/managed-state.json` | The managed config — authored by `ug setup` (admins) and refreshed from the workspace on launch |
| `~/.ucode/managed-backups/` | Baseline backups for OS-managed files changed by ug |

Existing files are backed up before being overwritten. `ug revert` restores backups.

### What `ug configure` and `ug` write for Claude Code

`ug configure` and every `ug` launch apply the workspace's managed config to these files:

- `~/.claude/ucode-settings.json`: the settings ug generates for Claude Code. Its `env` block sets `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` (the gateway), the per family default models `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL`, `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL`, `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL`, `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_FABLE_MODEL`, `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS`, any tracing variables, and, when the config uses model discovery, the gateway model discovery flag. When the config pins a static model list, ug also writes the model picker keys `availableModels`, `enforceAvailableModels`, and a `modelPicker` here, so `/model` shows exactly those models. Any ug managed `permissions` and hooks live here too.
- `~/.claude/settings.json`: Claude Code's own user settings. ug records the selected default model here.
- `~/.claude.json`: ug registers the Databricks `web_search` MCP server here when a suitable endpoint is available.
- `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json` (Linux) or `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json` (macOS): the OS enterprise managed settings. ug mirrors the same settings here so a bare `claude`, launched outside ug, still routes through the gateway. Writing this needs local admin rights; without them ug applies only the user level file above.

### What `ug configure` and `ug` write for Codex

- `~/.codex/ucode.config.toml`: the `ucode` profile that points Codex at the gateway. It sets `model_provider = "ucode-databricks"`, the `[model_providers.ucode-databricks]` block (gateway `base_url`, `wire_api`, the `auth` command, and headers), the default `model`, and, when the config pins a static model list, `model_catalog_json` pointing at the catalog file below.
- `~/.codex/ucode-models.json`: the model catalog ug generates from a static allow-list. Codex reads it through `model_catalog_json` so `/model` shows exactly those models. ug writes it only for a static list and removes it when the config uses discovery instead.
- `~/.codex/config.toml`: the legacy single file layout for Codex older than 0.134.0. ug writes the same settings under `[profiles.ucode]` here instead.
- `/etc/codex/managed_config.toml`: the OS enterprise managed Codex config. ug mirrors its Codex settings here so a bare `codex` uses the gateway. Writing this needs local admin rights.
