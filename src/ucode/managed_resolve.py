"""Resolve the effective agent settings from the managed config plus local ucode state.

The managed config (``~/.ucode/managed-state.json`` — authored by ``ucode setup`` and refreshed
from the workspace at launch, both through :mod:`ucode.managed_config`) and the developer's own
ucode state (``~/.ucode/state.json``) stay separate files — they are never merged on disk. Instead
this module resolves them *per key* at config-write time: whatever the manifest specifies wins, and
anything it leaves unset falls back to
the developer's ucode state. The resolved view is what gets rendered into the agent config files
(e.g. ``~/.claude/ucode-settings.json``), so managed settings take precedence for every ``ucode``
command without either file being rewritten.

Only settings the developer set *through* ucode participate in the fallback. Settings they wrote by
hand outside ucode (``~/.claude/settings.json``, etc.) are not read here — Claude Code merges
those scopes itself at launch, underneath the file ucode passes via ``--settings``.

Everything here is pure: no I/O, no mutation of the inputs. Fetching and persisting the manifest,
and handing the resolved state to the agent config writers, live in :mod:`ucode.managed_config`.
